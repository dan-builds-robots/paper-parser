# We're using ConvertAPI

to parse the pdf for text.

Here are the urls where parsing pdfs for text currently works:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01335v2.pdf
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08278v3.pdf
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08268v1.pdf

You can paste this in the url box and click "parse paper" and see the text eventually appear on the screen. It takes a little longer than I'd like, we might wanna find a faster API.
